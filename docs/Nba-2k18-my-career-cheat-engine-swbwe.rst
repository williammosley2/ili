   · NBA 2K18 Cheat Engine Table. Thu pm. The trainer work is not mine to claim. What I mostly did, was translate it to English, update the pointer to the new patch, add a couple of addresses and replace some static ones with a pointer-based address. I am a newbie when it comes to CE, so discussion about new addresses is welcome.  · This Cheat Engine table for NBA 2K18 PC contains a script that allows players to modify and edit various in-game settings. Pointers have been updated to the latest patch. Tested and fully working on Steam version only. Features. Change Teammate grade; Edit game sliders; MyCarreer options; MyGM/MyLeague options; Edit general game settings; RequirementsEstimated Reading Time: 7 mins.  · It's relatively easy to find the addresses for quarter and clock. Then you can make an offline career and find addresses for assists, points, steals, blocks etc. At the beginning there was no VC limit. I was able to get around VC (!) with one game. But after a patch I tried to make some VC again and got a ban.
